## Blog Project - Builded in Python/Django && React/NextJS

The app is a full-stack web application built using the Django, Next.js, and GraphQL frameworks. The backend of the app is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. The frontend is built using Next.js, a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered React applications. For the API, it is utilizing RESTAPI and GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows for more flexibility and efficient data retrieval. Together, these three frameworks allow for a seamless and efficient development process, enabling the app to handle both server-side and client-side logic with ease, and also to provide a powerful and flexible way to access the data from the backend. The app also allows real-time updates, fast performance, and easy integration with other technologies such as a database and external APIs.
Deployed on Vercel.

## Notes:

- The login functionality is built just for curiosity.
- The API built with Flask and Ariadne it is built for curiosity and has no effect on the app.
