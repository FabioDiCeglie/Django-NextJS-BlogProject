# Blog Project 

The app is a full-stack web application built using the Django, Next.js, and GraphQL frameworks. The backend of the app is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
The frontend is built using Next.js, a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered React applications. For the API, it is utilizing RESTAPI and GraphQL, a query language for APIs that allows for more flexibility and efficient data retrieval. 
Together, these three frameworks allow for a seamless and efficient development process, enabling the app to handle both server-side and client-side logic with ease, and also to provide a powerful and flexible way to access the data from the backend.

Deployed the app on Vercel and Render.
